# Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions in Python



Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

1. Addition: `2 + 3`
2. Subtraction: `5 - 2`
3. Multiplication: `4 * 6`
4. Division: `8 / 2`


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5

# Print the result
print(result)


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60

# Print the result
print(hours)


**Objectives:**

- List popular languages for Data Science.
- Introduce common libraries used by Data Scientists.
- Create and format markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Convert units of time in Python.
